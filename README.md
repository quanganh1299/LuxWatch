Lux watch website - final project in university
Description:
In my final university project, I undertook the challenge of creating a web interface with a focus on incorporating UX/UI principles. Leveraging the power of Figma as my design tool, I aimed to craft an intuitive and user-friendly interface. To bring the design to life, I employed the fundamental web technologies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a basic functional demo for the web application.

Objective:
The main objective of this project was to showcase my grasp of UX/UI principles and demonstrate how they can positively impact web interface design. Through the amalgamation of Figma's design capabilities and basic front-end development skills, I sought to deliver a seamless and enjoyable user experience.

I welcome any additional insights or specific preferences you may have. Your valuable contribution is highly appreciated!
